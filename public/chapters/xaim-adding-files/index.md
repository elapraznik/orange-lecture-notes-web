title: Adding files and images to lectures

Adding material to courses is a relatively simple procedure.

First, go to your course. Looking at the course, there is a blue turn-editing-on-box in the top right-hand corner. Click on the blue box, and the interface changes, allowing you to edit. All the sections now have an outward-pointing arrow, indicating to the user that the section is interchangeable and movable.

You can now add "activities and resources", useful for your course. You can add them to each section and create a completely modular course. 

We will be adding images and other files to lectures in two steps. The first step is to create the Folder resource in the welcome chapter of your lectures, and the second is uploading the files you wish to include in your lectures to the folder you created. 

Many instructional videos and texts explain how to drag and drop resources to courses. We will not be using those since it is important you upload all your documentation, files, and photos to the Folder resource, making the course content more secure, lasting and easier to navigate and manage. 

It is the easiest to choose Markdown to format text and import photos to Moodle. 

<h4>Adding a Folder resource<h4>
<p> 
At the top of your course page, locate the "add an activity or resource" tag in the bottom right corner of the course window. 
<p>
Once you open the "activity or resource" tag, you'll find many of them. Chose "Folder". The Folder is a repository, and you can upload images and other file types to it. We have changed the maximum size of folders to 100MB. 


<h4>Adding files to folder</h4>
<p>
In the "Images and other documents" window, click "Edit", then choose either the "files" or "folder" icons to determine what files or folders you want to upload.

Once you've finished, save changes, and you're done. 
You have now uploaded the files you can use in the courses. 

<h4>Adding images to individual lectures<h4>
<p>
In Moodle, adding images is done in your course's "Summary" field. You reach that through the "Edit" feature, found on the main page of your course. 
To add an image, start the line by writing an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in square brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. After the path or URL, you can optionally add a title in quotation marks.
It should look like this:
