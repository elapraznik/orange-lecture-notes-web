title: Adding files and images to lectures
date: January 2023

1. Go to your course. Looking at the course, there is a blue turn-editing-on-box in the top right-hand corner. 
   
2. Click on the blue box, and the interface changes, allowing you to edit. All the sections now have an outward-pointing arrow, indicating to the user that the section is interchangeable and movable and you are now in "editing mode".

3. You can now add "activities and resources", useful for your course. You can add them to each section and create a completely modular course. 


Many instructional videos and texts explain how to drag and drop resources to courses. We will not be using those since it is important you upload all your documentation, files, and photos to the Folder resource, making the course content more secure, lasting and easier to navigate and manage. 

It is the easiest to choose Markdown to format text and import photos to Moodle. 

<h4>Adding a Folder resource<h4>
<p>

1. At the top of your course page, locate the "add an activity or resource" tag in the bottom right corner of the course window. 
<p>

2. Once you open the "activity or resource" tag, you'll find many of them. Choose "Folder". The Folder is a repository, and you can upload images and other file types to it. The maximum upload size is 100MB. 


<h4>Adding files to folder</h4>
<p>

1. In the "Images and other documents" window, click "Edit", then choose either the "files" or "folder" icons to determine what files or folders you want to upload.

2. Choose the files (or folders) you want to upload, and upload them. Save changes, and you're done. 

3. You have now uploaded the files you can use in the courses. You determine which files to use through individual lecture of your course.

<h4>Adding images to individual lectures<h4>
<p>

1. In Moodle, adding images is done in your course's "Summary" field. You reach that through the "Edit" feature, found on the main page of your course. 
   
2. To add an image, start the line by writing an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in square brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. 
   
3. You find the path or URL by right-clicking your chosen image in the "Folder" and chosing "Copy Link Adress". After the path or URL, you can optionally add a title in quotation marks. 

It should look like this:
