In Moodle, you can add links to textural descriptions using Markdown (md.) format, which is a simple markup language. 

Open the text area where you want to add the link. This could be in a quiz description, an assignment description, or in a forum post, for example.

Highlight the text that you want to use as the link text.

To add a link, you can use the following syntax: [link text](URL), For example: [xAIM website](https://moodle.org/). 

Once you've added the link information, you should be able to click on the link text and be taken to the linked webpage.
