title: Adding material to courses
date: January 2023
---

Adding material to courses is a relatively simple procedure. There are three ways of doing it: 

First, go to your Course. Looking at the course, there is a blue turn-editing-on-box in the top right-hand corner. Click on the blue box and the interface changes, allowing you to edit. All the sections now have an outward-pointing arrow, indicating to the user that the section is interchangeable and movable.

There is another thing that you can now do: You can add “activities and resources”, useful for your course. You can add them to each section and create your own, completely modular course.
