All the users received an email, notifying them of the existence of an xAIM Moodle account. 
Use the link from the email to enter the login page.


Enter the details provided in the email in the corresponding input field in the sign-in form. 


If your sign-in was successful, you will have to provide a new password. 
If successful, you will now be able to sign into your account using your username and the new password. 

On the off-chance that you are interrupted during the password-changing process, start the process again, using the system-generated password to re-enter the moodle password-changing platform.
