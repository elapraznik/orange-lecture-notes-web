**Question bank**

Question bank is a feature that allows teachers to create, preview and edit questions in a database and use them in the quiz activity. 

Questions can be organized in categories and subcategories similar to the way files are stored in folders and subfolders. The question bank is accessed only by a specific moodle course and only by users with roles of teacher or higher. 

Once logged in to your Moodle course, there are two ways to access the question bank. Either via course navigation on the main course page by clicking on "More" > "Question bank" or via activity navigation on the quiz page by clicking on "Question bank". 

In order to add question to a quiz, you need to navigate to your quiz and add questions from there. It is not possible to add questions to a quiz starting from the question bank.

Questions from different quizzes are automatically stored in the question bank.
