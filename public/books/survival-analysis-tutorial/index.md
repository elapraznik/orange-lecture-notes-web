This is accompanying material for the Tutorial on Survival Analysis for PhD students at Baylor Collage of Medicine. This course provides a gentle introduction to survival analysis, from how to preprocess survival data to more complex data analysis pipelines. Throughout the training, students will learn to accomplish various survival tasks through visual programming and use [Orange](http://orangedatamining.com), our tool of choice for this course. If you have not already installed Orange, now would be a good time to visit its download page.

These course notes were prepared by Blaž Zupan, Ela Praznik, Jaka Kokošar and Martin Špendl with help from the members of the [Bioinformatics Lab](http://biolab.si) at [University of Ljubljana](http://www.uni-lj.si), Slovenia.
