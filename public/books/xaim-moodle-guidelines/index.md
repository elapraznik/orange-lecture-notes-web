Welcome to the [xAIM](https://xaim.eu/) [Moodle](http://xaim.biolab.si) user manual. The manual is intended to help teachers, teaching assistants, and other xAIM staff get familiar with Moodle - the chosen e-learning platform. 

Throughout the chapters, we will explain both the very basics of Moodle and some more advanced options. In the introduction, we will explain where users can find Moodle, how to log into Moodle and, later, how to communicate with students and how to use Moodle's quiz and question bank features.
